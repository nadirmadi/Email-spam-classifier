This dataset contains email data used for training and testing the spam classifier. Each record includes an email message and its corresponding label (spam or not spam).

### Jupyter Notebook: `Email_Spam_Classifier.ipynb`
The notebook includes the following steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Model training with machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
